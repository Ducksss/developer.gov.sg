### Quick form creation

Public officers can create digital forms quickly using an intuitive interface and publish these forms easily.

### Rich feature set

FormSG offers a set of features tailored to support public sector needs. FormSG offers more than 16 different fields, including table-input fields, OTP verification of contact details, email domain restrictions, control flow logic to disable submissions, and date validations.

### End-to-End encryption 

FormSG offers end-to-end encryption, which is not available in commercial form managers, to protect classified and sensitive data. All form responses are encrypted end-to-end (Storage mode) or sent directly to  public officersâ€™ email inboxes (Email mode). Third parties will not be able to access or view the form data. 

### Modularity supported

As a modular tool, FormSG can be used with other tools and services like identity providers or downstream case management tools in many government workflows.
