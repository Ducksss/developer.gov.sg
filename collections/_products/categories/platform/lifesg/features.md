### User-friendly guides
The app contains guides that integrate information across multiple Government agencies, making it convenient for users to view all the information they need at various life stages or to complete certain tasks, in one place. 

### Benefits and support module 
This shows at one glance the list of benefits that a user has received or may be entitled to, such as NS55 Recognition Package credits, NS Excellence Awards, NS Celebratory Gifts, GST Vouchers and SkillsFuture Credit. Eligible seniors can also view their Merdeka Generation e-card. 

### Eligibility checkers and calculators
By simply answering a few simple questions, users can view the list of Government support schemes they are eligible for and estimate the amount of benefits and support they can receive.

### Explore services conveniently
Users can explore and easily access more than 100 Government services. Information is grouped according to topics of interest, such as family and parenting, work and employment, healthcare, housing and property, and not according to agencies. 

### Profile with Inbox and Appointment functions
The Profile page allows users to retrieve and view personal information from multiple public agencies (e.g. Central Provident Fund Board, Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore) at one glance, with personalised charts for key categories. The Inbox serves as a consolidated touchpoint for users to be notified of announcements and the follow-ups required for key tasks at certain stages of a transaction. The Appointment feature allows users to get reminders for upcoming appointments or events signed up through LifeSG.
