### How Do You Onboard CFT?

Agencies and their partners can onboard and integrate CFT as a closed beta digital service in three simple steps:

1. Qualification for Closed-Beta
	- Agencies interested in participating in closed beta for CFT version 1.1 can sign up using the Tenant Onboarding form. As slots are limited, you are advised to sign up as soon as possible.

2. Technical Assessment
	- The CFT team will review your use case and if found suitable, follow-up with you for the implementation details.
	
3. Test, Sign and Use
	- Try out the CFT APIs and if our APIs are suitable for your use, get some simple paperwork done and you are good to go!
