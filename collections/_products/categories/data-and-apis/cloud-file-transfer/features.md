**Compliant with the Singapore governmentâ€™s AIAS and ICT&SS Management policy**

- CFT automatically scans incoming files for malware and removes malicious content.

**Large file exchanges with industry partners**

- CFT enables public officers to exchange up to 1GB of Restricted and Sensitive-Normal files with external parties across different applications and systems securely.

**File encryption**

- This ensures that data from agencies are safe and tamper-proof.

**Audit and monitor functions**

- Centralised controls and a simple user-interface offer end-to-end visibility on file transfers.

**Configurable security policies and workflows**

- Agencies can customize security policies and automated workflows according to their requirements.

**Event-driven notifications**

- Agencies can register their webhooks to enable real-time notifications during file transfers.

**Scheduling of file transfers**

- For example, uploading files to a common file repository at regular intervals.

**Time and cost savings**

- CFT can be set up quickly. Agencies are able to transfer files fast, without incurring the operational costs and overheads of setting up a similar service. They can scale as required based on their transfer needs.
