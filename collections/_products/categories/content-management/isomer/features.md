### Accessibility by default with pre-tested user interface 
Isomer enables websites that are usable and accessible to people with disabilities. For example, the Isomer template provides a selection of predefined font sizes and weights that cater to persons with low vision.

### Static site architecture
Public agencies can build websites that allow fast loading and eliminate vulnerabilities.

### Automated monitoring
This improves reliability and security of Isomer-created websites.

### WYSIWYG content editor
The Isomer Content Management System (CMS) offers an easy WYSIWYG editor that makes content editing a breeze.

### Integration with useful services
Isomer offers integration with services such as FormSG, CheckFirst, WOGAA, VICA, AskJamie, Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, and LinkedIn Insights.

### Auto-renewable SSL Certificate
Isomer provides free LetsEncrypt SSL certs that are automatically renewed every 90 days.

### Compliance with the Instruction Manual for ICT&SS Management
Isomer users do not need to worry about applicable clauses in the Instruction Manual for ICT&SS Management (previously known as IM8) for websites on Isomer. The fulfillment of these clauses will be centrally managed by GovTech.

### Secure by default
As Isomer sites are static sites, there are no databases to hack and no vulnerabilities like SQL injections or XSS. Pages are also cached on and served through CDN, allowing high average uptime of 99.99% while protecting the Isomer sites against DDoS attacks.
