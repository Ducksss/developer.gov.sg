  - name: Do I need to obtain a Vaccination HealthCert for travel?
    description: >
      We recommend getting a Vaccination HealthCert as airlines/foreign authorities overseas may request that you show a digitally verifiable proof of vaccination. Foreign authorities will be able to scan the QR codes on your Vaccination HealthCert to digitally verify that the certificate is secure and has not been tampered with.
      
      Please check the requirements of your destination before you travel, such as the vaccination proof and type/format of the proof accepted.
      
      You can refer to the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs website]([Ministry of Foreign Affairs website](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/where-are-you-travelling-to){:target="_blank"} for the latest travel advisories to other countries/ regions, and check with the embassy of the destination country/ region on the relevant health requirements for travellers from Singapore. Please also take note of the latest travel advisory for Singaporeans and residents of Singapore published by the Ministry of Health.
      
      Travellers intending to travel into Singapore using the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) should also refer to [information](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/vtl/faq){:target="_blank"} covering the requirements for VTL, such as the acceptable proof of vaccination.
  - name: My child is vaccinated but below the minimum age for Singpass i.e. 15 years old. How do I apply for my child’s Vaccination HealthCert?
    description: >
      Parents who use Singpass to apply for the Vaccination HealthCert should also be able to apply for their child’s Vaccination HealthCert at the same time.
      If your vaccinated child’s record is not showing, please obtain their Vaccination HealthCert using their passport number and dates of vaccination recorded in MOH databases. You may first need to update your child’s immunisation record by submitting a request to associate their vaccination records to their current passport number. Processing time for your query would be about 4 – 6 weeks. Visit this [link](https://go.gov.sg/health-cert-query){:target="_blank"} for more information.
  - name: How do I know if my document has been endorsed and can be used for overseas travel?
    description: >
      For PDT and Vaccination Healthcerts, you can check if your results are endorsed by MOH by scanning the QR code provided. If it brings you to [verify.gov.sg](www.verify.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}, and it is issued by MOH (i.e. healthcerts.moh.gov.sg or moh.gov.sg), it is endorsed. There should also be green ticks against the following statements: document has been issued, document has not been tampered, document's issuer has been identified.
