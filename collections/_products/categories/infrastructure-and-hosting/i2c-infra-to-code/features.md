### Ease of use
Export existing cloud infrastructure resources into Terraform templates to manage the cloud infrastructure as code with version control.

### Increased efficiency and time savings
With I<sub>2</sub>C, users can manage and maintain the cloud resources programmatically, thus reducing human errors, saving time, and increasing the speed to change.   

### Low-cost serverless, cloud-native solution 
Based on AWS lambda, API Gateway, Batch, Fargate and S3 Buckets, and other cloud native services, I<sub>2</sub>C can jumpstart your IaC (infrastructure as code) journey quickly and easily. 

### Automation
Reduce manual tasks involved in infrastructure provisioning and resource management. You can schedule the I<sub>2</sub>C API to run daily, allowing you to monitor and review changes in existing infrastructure.

### Better Visibility
Use the compliance report generated by I<sub>2</sub>C to review your existing cloud infrastructure configuration.

### Starting point for applying IaC practices
Users with foundational knowledge of Terraform can manipulate the Terraform configurations generated to suit project needs, removing the need to write Terraform Codes from scratch for deployment.
