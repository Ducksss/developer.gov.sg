### Overview

StackOps is part of the Monitoring component of the [Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview/index.html){:target="_blank"}, which are tools to help you track application performance and provide you with operational transparency for effective incident response.

### What is StackOps?

StackOps is a Monitoring toolchain that focuses on the most important and critical user actions of your service.

StackOps focuses on the most important and critical user actions of a service. It features automated reactions based on the golden monitoring and logging metrics (latency, load, limit, and errors).

StackOps consists of two main parts:
1. **StackOps Monitoring** is a package of monitoring applications (Prometheus, Thanos, and Grafana) that are centrally managed, automated, open-sourced, and easy to use.

2. **StackOps Logging** is a suite of centrally managed logging applications (Elastic, Logstash, and Kibana) that transforms and visualises your data from multiple sources.

### Why Should StackOps be Adopted?

Adopting StackOps can benefit users in the following ways:
-	User can start monitoring and logging their systems quickly and simply.
-	Creation of meaningful presentation of metrics that are aggregated based on what service owner, administrators, and customers need to know.
-	Fills current lack of monitoring and logging solutions that are quick and easy to set up.
-	Resolves problem of inability to track System Level Objectives (SLOs) of Whole-of Government (WOG) products and services.
-	Offers a one-stop-shop for monitoring the health of government services.
-	StackOps services will be whitelisted by General Availability (GA) by the end of 2021.

### How Do You Use StackOps?

### Success Stories

StackOps’ customer base grew from two to fifteen within five months. It is now used by SGTS products and the [Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/technologies/infrastructure-and-hosting/government-on-commercial-cloud.html){:target="_blank"} platform.

### What's Next?

The StackOps team is developing the StackOps Dashboard that enables a single-pane view of all services. It allows users to manage alerts, take remedial action against detected events, and easily publish their services’ availabilities to their target audiences.
