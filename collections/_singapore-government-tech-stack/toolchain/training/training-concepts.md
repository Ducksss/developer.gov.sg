- **Continuous Integration:** A software engineering approach where the code developed are merged into a shared code repository frequently and then verified by automated build and testing.

- **Continuous Delivery:** A software engineering approach to automate the release process. The production worthy changes are kept in a releasable state but may or may not deployed into production automatically.
