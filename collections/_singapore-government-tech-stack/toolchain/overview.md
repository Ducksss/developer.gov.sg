# What is SHIP-HATS? 

**SHIP (Secure Hybrid Integration Pipeline)-HATS (Hive Agile Testing Solutions)** is the Continuous integration/continuous delivery [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) component within SG Tech Stack (SGTS) with security and governance guardrails that enables developers to plan, build, test and deploy code to production.  

This is a multi-tenanted Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) hosted on Government Commercial Cloud(GCC) for all applications that is classified as restricted and below. 

# Why is CI/CD important? 

## Benefits of SHIP-HATS 

1. **Policy Compliance** - Standardised development tools and environment that is set up in compliance with **Application Infrastructure Architecture Standard(AIAS)** and **Instruction Manual 8 on Information Technology(IM8)** policies  
2. **Better Quality** - Automated security testing detects vulnerabilities early in the development cycle helping to deliver high quality applications 
3. **Visibility & Transparency** â€“  Agencies will always have access to source code and hence a better understanding of how the project is progressing  
4. **Reduce Procurement** Access to a whole suite of tools instead of sourcing individually  
5. **GovTech Managed** - The CI/CD tools are set-up, hosted, maintained and supported by GovTech letting you focus on your core application.
