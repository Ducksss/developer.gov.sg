<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  As more services go digital, the need for Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions becomes more urgent and important to enable us to enforce strict privileged access to such digital services. However, existing IAM solutions are often decentralised, making it cumbersome for users as they have to manage multiple digital identities to access different digital services. Decentralised IAM solutions also lower the effectiveness of controls and governance over digital identities. Furthermore, there is increasing emphasis on various security frameworks such as Zero Trust to protect end users and their organisation. In response to these problems, TechPass was developed as a federated, centralised Single Sign On (SSO) IAM for downstream developer services. With TechPass, users can reduce the number of digital identities they need to manage, while administrators can easily control access to their digital services on a single platform, while having the assurance that the management of these identity accounts complies with the relevant government policies.

  TechPass is one out of three tools in the Engineering Suite, which is part of the Service Management component in the Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS). Engineering Suite offers a suite of service management tools for government officers to discover, subscribe, and manage SGTS services on a single console.
