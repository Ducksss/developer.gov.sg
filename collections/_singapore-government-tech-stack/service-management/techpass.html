<h2>TechPass Overview</h2>
<h3>TechPass - The Engineering Suite tool</h3>
<p>
  The first product in the pipeline for Engineering Suite is TechPass that
  allows users to use a single set of credentials for all SGTS services.
</p>
<p>
  TechPass will serve as the identity for SGTS for all developers. Developers
  from agencies can authenticate with their Whole of Government (WoG) Azure AD
  identities to access SGTS services. Non-government or vendor developers can
  access SGTS services using localised identities, which are subject to
  approval.
</p>
<p>
  Onboarded Tenants (e.g.: SHIP-HATS) can easily manage access control from a
  self-service portal.
