<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
CStack is part of the Runtime component in the <a href="/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview/#!" target="_blank">Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)</a>. It helps agencies reduce overheads in setting up and maintaining the infrastructure required for DevSecOps so that development teams can focus on building great products. By leveraging CStack, agencies can kickstart their DevSecOps practices and accelerate their journey into agile application development.
</p>

<h2>What is CStack?</h2>

<p>
  CStack is a cloud-based container development and hosting platform (<a href="/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/im8" target="_blank">IM8 compliant</a>) that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Leverages features of Kubernetes to automate deployment, and manage & scale containerised applications.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Integrates with <a href="/singapore-government-tech-stack/toolchain/overview.html" target="_blank">SHIP-HATS</a> to enable Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CICD) and automated application testing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Automates application deployment where Git is the single source of truth.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Provisions and integrates cloud managed services such as object storage and relational databases using a declarative approach.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Provides dashboards for developers to monitor their system metrics.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Secures your workloads by providing an integrated set of container security tools.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Should CStack be Adopted?</h2>

<p>
  The benefits of CStack include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Leverage</strong> CStack product team’s collective expertise to manage Kubernetes for you so that your team can focus on building great products.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Kickstart</strong> your DevSecOps practices and agile development from day one rather than spending time setting up tools for development yourself.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Elevate</strong> developer experience and performance: CStack fills the gap between operations and developers by enabling developers to manage infrastructure through code. CStack also allows agencies to deploy fast and learn from feedback with each release.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Stay</strong> secure and compliant with every release: CStack’s infrastructure-as-code and policies-as-code mechanisms offer agencies the ability to enable automated auditing, thereby ensuring that your applications or services stay secure and compliant with every release.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How Do You Use CStack?</h2>

<h2>Success Stories</h2>

<p>
  The MOE Digital Office leveraged CStack to launch a campaign microsite for <a href="https://thankyoucher.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Teacher’s Day 2021</a>. The microsite was custom developed using a containerised Wordpress engine that is deployed using CStack.
</p>
<p>
  CStack provided the development team a compliant platform which allowed them to reduce the scope of Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT).  The reduced scope then allowed them to complete the VAPT exercise within 1.5 months, despite the small team consisting of only three members.
