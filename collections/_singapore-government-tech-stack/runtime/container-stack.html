<h2>Container Stack</h2>
<p>
  Container Stack (CStack) is a
  <strong>cloud-based container hosting platform</strong>. It also offers
  agencies the ability to kickstart, and/or accelerate their agile and
  DevOps/DevSecOps practices and culture without the overhead to setup and
  maintain the required infrastructure and moving parts. CStack is currently in
  private beta version.
</p>

<h3>A Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS) Product</h3>
<p>
  CStack is one of the <strong>Runtime components</strong> within <a href="/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview" >the Base Layer
  of the SGTS</a>.
</p>
<h3>CStack for DevOps/DevSecOps</h3>
<p>
  Having a successful DevOps/DevSecOps culture helps agencies release product
  features and bug fixes to production at a quicker pace compared to a
  traditional software development model. This allows agencies to be more agile,
  innovate faster, adapt to markets better, respond to customers’ needs quicker,
  improve efficiency at delivering results and more.
</p>
<p>
  Under the hood, CStack leverages Kubernetes to automate deployment, managing
  and scaling containerised applications. It integrates with <a href="/technologies/devops/ship">SHIP</a>-<a href="/technologies/devops/hats">HATS</a> to enable Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery/Deployment
  (CICD), automated and continuous testing.

</p>
<p>
  CStack’s platform is <a href="/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/im8" >IM8 compliant</a> and will ensure it stays compliant as
  policy changes. As CStack enforces infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and
  policies-as-code, agencies are equipped with the tools and mechanism to
  automate the audit of their applications for compliance.
</p>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<h5>Springboard to Agile/DevOps/DevSecOps practices</h5>
<p>
  CStack offers agencies a quick way to ride on the Agile/DevOps/DevSecOps
  journey without the complexity and overheads to set up and maintain the
  infrastructure and moving parts.
</p>
<h5>Elevate developer experience and performance</h5>
<p>
  CStack bridges the gaps between ops and developers, allowing agencies to
  deploy fast, get feedback and learn with each cycle. This results in better
  developer experience and confidence.
</p>
<h5>Stay secure and compliant with every release</h5>
<p>
  CStack’s infrastructure as code and policies as code mechanism offers agencies
  the ability to configure policies for their application to enable automated
  auditing, allowing your applications or services stay secure and compliant
  with every release.
</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<h5>Built on Kubernetes</h5>
<p>
  Under the hood, CStack uses Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration
  engine. Agencies get to enjoy all
  <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
    >features that Kubernetes offers</a
  >. CStack doesn’t add any abstraction layer so you can tap on existing
  community resources to configure your containers or workloads.
</p>
<h5>GitOps Methodology</h5>
<p>
  CStack follows the GitOps principles in that Git is the one and only single
  source of truth. Together with Kubernetes, the desired state of the whole
  system in various environments (such as dev, stage, or production) are
  described through codes and are version controlled so that any changes are
  traceable and auditable.
</p>
<h5>Seamlessly integrate with managed services</h5>
<p>
  CStack’s adapters connect your application seamlessly to managed services such
  as object storage, and managed SQL databases.
</p>
<h5>Observability and monitoring</h5>
<p>
  CStack provides a dashboard powered by ElasticSearch and Grafana to allow
  teams to visualize their logs or metrics. Additionally, teams can hook up to
  Telegram/Slack for conditional notifications.
</p>
