**The Digital Academy**, which aims to strengthen the digital competencies of Public Officers, is now available to Whole-of-Government following the soft launch in January 2021 to GovTech and Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO).

Agencies can leverage this “Practitioner-for-Practitioner” academy to upskill and deepen officers’ capabilities based on the ICT&SS Competency Framework. The Academy will offer 55 programmes across several domains, including Data Science & AI, Infrastructure & Architecture and Cybersecurity. The full suite of courses will be available by the end of March 2022. 

Stay tuned for the official launch of The Digital Academy in June 2021, which will follow a week-long Learning Festival for Public Officers to embark on an enriching learning journey.
