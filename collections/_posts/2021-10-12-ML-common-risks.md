In order to cater to the demand for complex interconnected systems, Machine Learning (ML) systems have evolved from traditional IT systems, which are typically simple programmes that handle simple datasets. ML systems create more opportunity by enabling organisations to process more complex use-case which are typically done by humans.

### FEATURES OF ML SYSTEMS

### KEY CYBERSECURITY FACTORS AND APPROACHES

ML systems process and distil massive amounts of data, reinforcing the need for fundamental cybersecurity measures to protect data confidentiality and integrity, as well as to maintain the availability of ML services. Organisations may consider the following key factors and cybersecurity approaches:
