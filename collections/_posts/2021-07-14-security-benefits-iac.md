Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is the **process of provisioning and managing resources in public clouds using text files that describe infrastructure resource configurations**. It is a key feature of Container Stack (CStack), a cloud-based container hosting platform and one of the Runtime components within the Base Layer of the Singapore Government Tech Stack. Essentially, implementing IaC automates the management of an application’s tech stack and replaces manual effort required for resource management. Some examples of IaC tools include Terraform, Puppet, Ansible and Chef.

This article explains the importance of IaC by discussing its benefits and how it augments defence against risks.
