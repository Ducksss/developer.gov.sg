The Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA) aims to support the Smart Nation initiative by harnessing information and communication technologies, networks and big data to create tech-enabled solutions. It is part of the [Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)](https://www.tech.gov.sg/images/programmes/products-and-services/sgts-infographic-28-Sep.jpg), functioning as a middleware, and has the mission to “Improve Government Services with data”. This ground-up initiative is by Digital Design Development (DCube) and Government Digital Services (GDS).
