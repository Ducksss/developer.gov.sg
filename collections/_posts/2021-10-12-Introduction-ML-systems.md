In order to cater to the demand for complex interconnected systems, Machine Learning (ML) systems have evolved from traditional IT systems, which are typically simple programmes that handle simple datasets. ML systems create more opportunity, processing and communicating more data across many different processing endpoints and units.

*** FEATURES OF ML SYSTEMS



*** MITIGATING THE RISKS OF USING ML SYSTEMS

The table below describes key risk areas of using ML systems and possible mitigation measures to reduce associated residual risks.

*** KEY CYBERSECURITY FACTORS AND APPROACHES

ML system processes and distils massive amounts of data, reinforcing the need for fundamental cybersecurity measures to protect data confidentiality and integrity, as well as maintain the availability of ML services. Organisations[CLO(1] [OSD2]  may consider the following key factors and cybersecurity approaches:
