#### Why is Community-building Important to You?

When I returned to Singapore after almost four years abroad, I felt like I lost my community. I no longer had the same work family and friends to lean on which led me to decide that I had to rebuild my networks in Singapore.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“I see community-building as having a library of people. Your people are resources that you can refer to when you need inspiration and guidance in your journey, not only industry-wise but also in life. I also believe that having a strong community is key to success in life and work.”</i></p>

### How Did You First Build Your Community

The first step was to find people with common interests– starting a design community in my case. The next step was to invite them out for coffee. The third step is to pick a good coffee place! I did not have any agenda apart from getting to know each other and figuring out if we clicked.
