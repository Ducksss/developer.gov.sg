#### Quick Tips from Min Li
1. Form a supportive leadership team that aligns with your values and goals for the community.
2.	Do not be afraid to reach out to your social and professional networks to grow your community and learn from existing community leaders.
3.	Ensure your fellow admin team members are always kept in the loop and act as a coherent unit.

#### Why is community-building important to you?
When I returned to Singapore after almost four years abroad, I felt like I lost my community. I no longer had the same work family and friends to lean on which led me to decide that I had to rebuild my networks in Singapore.
