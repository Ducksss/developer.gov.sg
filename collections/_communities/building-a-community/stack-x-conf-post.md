## HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE CONFERENCE 

Participants gained valuable insights about how to modernise securely using CI/CD with SHIP-HATS and access end-to-end support resources provided by GovTech to facilitate the adoption of SHIP-HATS. These were delivered through the Product and Government tracks that catered to participants’ varied needs, from showing how SHIP-HATS enables early identification of critical vulnerabilities in the development cycle to providing practical steps for them to adopt SHIP-HATS. Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and senior IT leaders also got to better understand considerations in implementing CI/CD, and how to manage vendors and security through CI/CD.
