<h2>GovTech’s Community Development Efforts</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col is-12">
    <p>
      We are excited to engage with the wider developer ecosystem as we continue to
      build and refine digital products. We believe that our goal – to build better
      products for the public good – can be achieved only through meaningful
      collaboration with the developer community.
    </p>
    <p>
      We see co-creation with the community as essential because innovation can
      happen anywhere; no single organisation or developer will have a monopoly on
      great ideas and inventions.
    </p>
