### Overview

LifeSG is a one-stop resource hub for over 70 government services. It consolidates and simplifies access to government services so that citizens can spend less time browsing multiple websites or apps. As a citizen-centric platform, LifeSG transforms how citizens interact with the Government by providing easy access to government services, personalised experiences, and meaningful solutions.

### What is LifeSG?

LifeSG was initially launched as Moments of Life (MOL), which aimed to serve parents with young children. In August 2020, MOL was rebranded as LifeSG with a new vision to serve citizens during various key stages of their lives.

The app consolidates services and information across various Government agencies, and provides recommendations that are personalised according to user profiles and preferences. Users can explore more than 70 government services and receive reminders for appointments and event bookings made on the app. 
One such service is electronic birth registration, which currently handles 70% of birth registrations in Singapore. The electronic birth registration service integrates birth registration, application for government grant (Baby Bonus), and National Library Board (NLB) membership into a single process, thereby reducing the typical time spent from an hour to just 15 minutes.

To date, the LifeSG app has been downloaded more than 290,000 times. It has facilitated a range of services including electronic birth registration, eligibility checking for more than 30 types of COVID-19 grants and assistance, and access to Merdeka Generation (MG) or Pioneer Generation (PG) e-cards.

### Why Should LifeSG be Adopted? 

The key benefits of LifeSG are:

- **Convenience at Your Fingertips:** LifeSG provides citizens with convenient access to important government services, rather than require them to navigate multiple websites or apps.
- **Government Services that are Clear and Simple:** LifeSG connects citizens with relevant services and information by providing personalised recommendations.
- **Set Up Your Account in Minutes:** Citizens can set up their profiles on LifeSG instantly with [Myinfo](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/technologies/digital-identity/myinfo.html){:target="\_blank"}. Myinfo enables ease of filling up government forms as users only have to provide their personal data once and they can tap on pre-filled forms for subsequent transactions with the Government.

### How Do You Use LifeSG?

Users can connect with the Government using following features on LifeSG:

- **Personalised Dashboard:** LifeSG's home screen displays a dashboard that contains content, services, and events that are personalised based on the user’s profile.
- **User-Friendly Guides:** LifeSG contains guides that integrate information across multiple government agencies, making it convenient for users to view all the relevant information they might need in a centralised location.
- **Personalised Benefits and Support Module:** View at a glance a list of benefits that a user has received or may be entitled to, such as GST Vouchers and SingapoRediscover Vouchers (SRV). Over 21,000 users accessed this module in January 2021.
- **Personalised Eligibility Checkers and Calculators:** By simply answering a few simple questions, users can view the list of government support schemes they are eligible for and estimate the amount of benefits and support they can receive. This provides much added convenience as users no longer have to navigate and process the eligibility criteria of each individual scheme.
- **Explore Services:** Citizens can explore and easily access various government services. Information is grouped according to topics of interest, such as family and parenting, work and employment, healthcare, and housing and property. About 10,000 users access this feature each month.
- **Integrated Services:** For some complex transactions, LifeSG integrates multiple government touchpoints to provide a more seamless experience. This includes the electronic birth registration service, which enables new parents to register for Baby Bonus and even sign up for a library card for their child, all at the same time.

### Success Stories

- With LifeSG, Chien Koh Wei, a second-time dad, was able to swiftly register the birth of his second child and saved himself a trip to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) building. The app enabled Koh Wei to complete the birth registration process as well as apply for the Baby Bonus without leaving his wife’s side. When the time comes for Koh Wei to plan for his children’s future, he can also easily search and narrow down childcare centres and preschools with LifeSG.
- Apart from new parents, LifeSG has also helped Cheryl Choo, an enthusiastic volunteer who frequently assists senior citizens. Cheryl shared that LifeSG is one of the best ways for senior citizens to check on the government policies or schemes that apply to them. She teaches the elderly to search for ongoing active ageing programmes and join community networks using the LifeSG app, thereby enabling them to maintain an active social life. Aside from her voluntary work, Cheryl also uses LifeSG to check on her HDB grants and loan eligibility while making financial plans for her new home with her fiancé.

### What's Next?

The LifeSG team plans to improve the dashboard to provide citizens with an overview of key personal information such as their CPF, housing, and education details. They also aim to continuously add new features to serve citizens in other aspects of their life journey.
