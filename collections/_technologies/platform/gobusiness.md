The Government provides many services and information for businesses, which spans multiple agencies and platforms. To help businesses easily locate relevant resources in a simple and fast way, GoBusiness was developed as a central portal to provide businesses with integrated, seamless, and personalised access to relevant information, services, and resources across all stages of the business journey.

Developed by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO), Ministry of Trade & Industry (MTI) and Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), GoBusiness represents the Government’s commitment to provide easy-to use, seamless, and relevant services for businesses, and to create a more pro-enterprise environment for businesses in Singapore.
