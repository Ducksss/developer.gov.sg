### Overview

With more people interacting with the government through websites and mobile applications, it becomes increasingly important for the government to 
understand the user experience and impact of its digital services. This inspired the creation of WOGAA.

WOGAA monitors the performance of government websites and digital services in real-time in a convenient and user-friendly manner. It presents key 
information such as website traffic, user feedback, recommendations to improve site performance as well as benchmarks against whole-of-government (WOG) 
averages in a single dashboard. These useful data points coupled with a fuss-free user interface, allows public officers to conveniently access the information 
they need so that they can make effective data-driven decisions and proactively improve their services. Providing this as a central service allows the 
government to reap benefits from economies of scale and provide additional cross-agency features such as performing comparisons across other government agencies, 
sectors and users to cultivate the notion of learning from one another and accelerate improvements.

### What is WOGAA?

If you are picturing WOGAA as a single dashboard, you will be surprised to find that WOGAA consists of four micro products integrated onto one platform. 
This provides an end to end toolbox for users to maintain government digital services holistically.

Implementing WOGAA is simple as users just need to integrate two lines of JavaScript code and they are good to go.

The four key features of WOGAA are as shown below.

- **WOGAA Uptime:** This feature tracks daily uptime and downtime of digital services and notifies users via email and/or SMS instantaneously when their 
website becomes unavailable. This allows agencies and their vendors to rectify the issue promptly and ensure that their digital services remain available 
to the public. 
- **WOGAA Inspect:** This feature generates technical scores in the areas of Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and Searchability/Search Engine 
Optimisation (SEO). To increase these scores, WOGAA Inspect also provides users with actionable technical recommendations that directly tackles the areas 
of improvement. This gives users immediate next steps to readily improve the usability of their digital services.
- **WOGAA Analytics:** This feature provides an overview of how a user's digital services are performing in a user-centric dashboard. 
This gives users the option of assessing digital service performances across WOG or viewing a specific agency's performance for more granular data analysis. 
Key metrics such as the total number of visitors, average time spent by visitors, trending pages etc are displayed to provide a deeper understanding of 
audience preferences and behaviours.
