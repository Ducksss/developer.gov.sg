### Overview

With the amount and quality of video data collected increasing every day, Video Analytics (VA) algorithms are gaining popularity in use-cases that include situational awareness, post-incident investigation, real-time analysis and monitoring, and extraction of insights and trends for further analysis.

VA is already being used in counting number of pedestrians to assess pathway effectiveness, counting number of fish feed to optimise the operations of aquaculture hatcheries, and many others.

Government agencies who are new to VA often find themselves these questions: How can we kickstart a VA project quickly and effortlessly? How can we leverage our own and other agencies’ videos for analysis? Is it possible to develop our own VA models without being locked in by private commercial vendors? How can we make use of the existing VA algorithms by GovTech?

Having worked with multiple agencies on a myriad of CCTV and VA requirements, GovTech’s Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID) developed the Video Analytics System (VAS), a central platform for agencies to meet their VA needs.

### What is VAS?

As a central platform, VAS aims to:
- Enable agencies to develop and deploy VA solutions.
- Exchange video data and analytics expertise across the whole-of-government (WOG).
- Expand the video sensor network and insights derived.

The key components of VAS are:

**Media Hub (video sharing platform)**
- Supports the upload, playback, search, request, and sharing of videos.
- Stream videos from cameras for on-demand viewing.

**Insights Service (VA-as-a-service)**
- Generate insights for your videos based on readily developed VA services for detection and counting of relevant events and objects
- Currently available VA Services:
  - Smoking action detection
  - Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs) / pedestrians / cyclists’ detection
  - Vehicle Dwell Time analysis and number plate recognition
- Allows customisation of regions of interest.
- Generate shareable reports and be notified when the analysis is completed.
- Export reports in CSV format for custom analysis.

**VA Enablement Service (VideoIO)**
- Train VA model based on a selection of common deep learning model options to detect objects of interest.
- Curate and manage custom datasets for the training process.
- Review and perform annotation for both video and images.
- Initial and monitor model training runs and be notified when the training has completed. 
- Test VA model by performing predictions using custom trained model versions.
- Export prediction results to CSV/JSON formats.

**Metadata Service**
- Search and filter aggregated metadata according to available attributes, such as Vehicle Type (e.g., bicycle or Personal Mobility Device (PMD)), Event Type Attribute (e.g., Smoking), and Spatial Attributes (e.g., postal code).
