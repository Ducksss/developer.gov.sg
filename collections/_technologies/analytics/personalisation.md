**What is Personalisation?**
============================

  
Personalisation is the act of dynamically **_interpreting an individual’s intent_** and **_curating tailored experiences_** that help the individual to **_achieve that intent seamlessly_** across channels.

When creating personalised experiences, you first need to understand who you are serving. To **_Recognise_** is the ability to identify both known and unknown users when they interact with your products / services.   

Besides identifying the user, you need to **_Remember_** how they previously engaged with your product / service, why they chose to interact with your product / service in that way and what their interests and preferences are. These can give you insight into what their intent could be when they interact with your product / service again.

Once you have built an understanding of the user, you are now better able to recommend **_Relevant_** content and services based on their intent of using your product / service. As past behaviour does not always predict future actions, it is important to also take into account contextual data and real-time user behaviour which will clarify what their intent is.

Through multiple interactions, you start to develop a **_Relationship_** with your users. This involves seeking their feedback to create more individualised experiences for each user. As the relationship deepens, the likelihood of repeat engagements increases and users will expect a more seamless and personalised experience across all touchpoints.

**Why is it important to you and your citizens?**

  

In general, the value of personalisation lies in how it enables people to make quicker and more satisfying decisions that lead to more enjoyable or beneficial outcomes. This in turn leads to increased usage of a product / service and greater engagement with a brand or organisation.

  

Value to citizens

  

There are broadly two types of activities that people perform on government touchpoints –  
1) look for information and 2) complete transactions. 

  

People value personalisation when it leads to greater time savings and / or help them make better and more informed decisions as they perform the above-mentioned activities.   

Value to agencies

  

When personalisation helps to achieve the above, it naturally leads to improved customer experience, increased usage of services, more effective targeting and greater engagement which are some of the outcomes that agencies seek to achieve.

  

Furthermore, when done right, personalisation can make citizens feel valued and understood and allows agencies to forge a stronger relationship with citizens. This in turn spurs greater citizen participation, satisfaction and trust in the government. 

  

**Personalisation principles**

  

Personalisation generates the desired benefits only if done properly. There are many ways in which personalisation could go wrong e.g. if it is seen to be too intrusive, it’s done “to” the user rather than “for” the user and / or it makes wrong assumptions about the user. Ultimately, what agencies want to create is a personalised experience that makes citizens feel understood and valued, rather than an experience where citizens feel like they are being watched.

  

As such, it is important to take into account the following considerations in any personalisation initiative: 

  
**_Personalisation is useful_** _\-_ Any personalisation strategy has to bring real value to citizens. Agencies should consider whether it helps to generate one or more of the following benefits for people they are serving:  
Help people to discover relevant information more easily

*   Surface useful information that people may not be aware of
    
*   Reduce repeated or unnecessary entry of information
    
*   Guide people through complex transactions
    

  

**_Personalisation is relevant_** - Effective personalisation starts with understanding our users’ intent and then provides relevant information at the right time. 

  

**_Personalisation is individualised_** - It starts by understanding and classifying our users based on Segments, Archetypes and Individual. 

  

**_Personalisation is a dialogue_** - Personalisation efforts should encompass continuous, two-way dialogue that resembles conversations that customers would have with an in-store salesperson. This is because people don’t want to be limited by what can be predicted about them, but to own and drive the experience they receive at their own terms.

  

**_Personalisation protects privacy_** - Agencies should only collect data that is required to deliver personalised experiences that users value, as well as be transparent on what data is collected and how it is being used. They should ensure that appropriate steps are taken to prevent data breaches or mishandling. 

**What do we offer?**

  

The **_Personalise_** team offers the following to help you achieve your personalisation journey:

  

1.  **Personalisation Workshop**
    

This workshop is a good starting point for teams who are still learning about personalisation as well as need more help developing and scoping their personalisation strategy and goals. We will help you and your team deepen your understanding of personalisation, set personalisation goals based on user needs and challenges, brainstorm ideas as well as scope the effort. Once your strategy and goals are established, we will work with you to achieve them using our email and web personalisation tools.

2.  **Email Personalisation Tool**
    

Our web-based email product allows you to personalise email campaigns in a variety of ways. Some examples include:

*   Sending out different emails to different audience segments based on specific criteria, such as interests indicated in your newsletter signup
    
*   Reaching out to a group of citizens who has interacted with your websites before and read at least one newsletter article on an upcoming campaign
    
*   Reaching out to less active citizens to inform them about a new service that is relevant to them 
    

3.  **Web Personalisation Tool**
    

To improve the citizen experience, this tool helps bring relevant content to your citizens through your websites. There are 3 phases to this implementation:

1.  Learning phase - our javascript embedded in your website would learn the behaviour of your users and build a recommendation model based on their browsing pattern
    
2.  Implementation phase - after the learning phase, you would then design the interface and integrate the API that provides the recommendations. For example, you could design a carousel hero banner on your landing page that shows personalised contents that our scripts provide. 
    
3.  Optimisation phase - our system will help you to track and monitor key metrics to ensure that we are serving the best content for your users as well as recommend improvements to increase accuracy.  
    

**How can you start?**

  
We make it easy for any team to kick start their personalisation journey. To get started, email us at hello@personalise.gov.sg with your ideas and questions.
