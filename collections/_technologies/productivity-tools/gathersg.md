### Overview

GatherSG is a lightweight case management and case coordination system that is built for all domains. There are a variety of modern features such as Kanban Board, Collaborative Assessment, Collaborative Minutes Taking, integrated video conferencing tool, Statistical Dashboard designed and built with the Whole-of-Government (WOG) context.

The aim is to foster a vibrant ecosystem whereby developers can leverage a “modified open-source” concept using ready codebase and reusable components to quickly build sub-systems to optimise their operations, thereby serving citizens better.

### What is GatherSG?

GatherSG* currently supports nine different tracks across the social service and public service sectors. It covers outreach, referral and coordination, case management, feedback, and appeal. 

For social service, GatherSG – Case Connect is a sub-system that transforms the social service sector by optimising how agencies reach out, coordinate, and work together with citizens in need to effectively render social support, enabling operational efficiency. It also helps agencies better track referrals and cases of varying complexities that require inter-agency teams to service.

Some notable features include:

-	Kanban board
-	Collaborative assessment
-	Case assignment
-	Polling 
-	Integration with video conferencing tool

As a part of the [Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview/){:target="\_blank"}, GatherSG is designed to be easily reusable for different use cases. It is used today in vaccination engagement for seniors, grocery vouchers appeal, operation of Singapore Government integrated service centres, and many others. The tech stack approach allows GatherSG to react to new demand and changes in a more agile manner: faster, cheaper, better security, while maintaining best practices in service design delivery. 

In several covid response tracks, the GatherSG team reused the stack and pushed out new tracks of government digital services within 2 weeks’ time, which would have been difficult without GatherSG as the base stack.

*_Government Assisted Living Ecosystem (GALE)  is an older system that is now incorporated under GatherSG_.  

### Why Should GatherSG be Adopted?
