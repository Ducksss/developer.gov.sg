### Overview

DOSS is a lightweight, flexible operations management platform that works with different sensor hardware and robot systems to enable next-generation 
digital operations. DOSS allows operators to navigate robots remotely and autonomously over land, air and sea.

By combining sensor data with artificial intelligence (AI), DOSS also performs real-time analytics such as identifying objects, measuring distance and 
counting the number of people a robot “sees”.

DOSS’s AI capabilities and hardware-neutral approach make it a powerful platform for augmenting human operations in a diverse range of operational environments.

DOSS is part of the Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP), a whole-of-government (WOG) technology platform that translates data from sensors and IoT devices 
into a 360° awareness of what is happening in urban spaces in Singapore.

DOSS is a product within the Operations layer of the SNSP Framework (i.e. SNSP’s tech stack). Operations technologies such as DOSS allow users to interact 
with the physical world through a digital platform, including conveying instructions back to the physical world.

### What is DOSS?

With DOSS, we have developed advanced capabilities in real-time sensor data analytics and deep learning techniques to power flexible sensors, robotics, and 
digital operations.

DOSS is a smart platform that uses different AI methods, including:

- **Deep learning:** A sub-field of AI that uses algorithms inspired by the human brain called neural networks to discover complex patterns in rich data.
- **Computer vision:** A sub-field of AI that uses deep learning models to allow computers to identify and classify objects within images and videos — 
and then react to what they “see.”

### Why Should DOSS be Adopted?

- **Remote control of robots:** Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) control allows operators to navigate robots remotely anywhere in Singapore over a 
4G or 5G connection. Pilot robots from the comfort of an office or operating room and see live video streams from the robot’s point of view.
- **Autonomous navigation of robots:** Autonomy allows robots to navigate an environment without human intervention to enhance operational capacity 
and efficiency. GovTech has been developing autonomous navigation in both indoor, controlled environments, and large, unstructured, outdoor ones like parks.
- **Real-time analytics:** DOSS’s analytics features include:
  - **Thermal sensing:** This is used in SPOTON, a smart thermal scanner with face detection that screens up to 10 people at once.
·	Safe distance measurements: Detects the distance between two people. When the safe distance limit is breached, the robot can automatically broadcast a reminder to keep a safe distance.
·	People counting: Counts the number of people in a frame to help operators estimate crowd density.
·	Face mask detection: Detects whether a person is wearing a face mask.
·	Follow-me: Using a single camera, tracks a person from a real-time video stream – allowing robots to follow operators for delivery, logistics and critical operations.
