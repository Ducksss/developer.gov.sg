### Overview

PAB is part of the [Government Assisted Living Ecosystem (GALE)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/technologies/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/government-assisted-living-ecosystem){:target="_blank"}, a collection of technologies and services to give our seniors greater peace of mind to live safely and independently. 

### What is the PAB?

PAB is an alert device that can be installed in an elderly’s home. When a senior in distress activates the PAB, a distress signal will be sent to either a [Senior Activity Centre (SAC)](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medical-and-care-facilities/8/senior_activity_centre){:target="_blank"} or [CareLine](https://www.singhealth.com.sg/rhs/live-well/CareLine/about-us){:target="_blank"}, which is a 24-hour telecare service provided by Changi General Hospital (CGH).

PAB enables 10-second audio recordings to be sent from distressed seniors to staff from SAC and CareLine. Upon receiving the recordings, staff will triage the situation and respond accordingly. If necessary, staff may communicate with the distressed senior using the
PAB’s 4G technology which enables two-way communication.

### Why Should the PAB be Adopted?

PAB is a fast and responsive device that enables our seniors to live safely and independently by providing round-the-clock monitoring and assistance. 

The seniors are allowed to determine the location of the devices as they are wireless and battery-operated, with a lifespan of around 5 years.


### How Do You Use the PAB?

Use the PAB by following these steps:

1. **PRESS** the red button if you are in distress and need help. (Press the blue button on the side of the PAB to cancel the distress signal if you pressed the red button by accident.)
2. **TELL** the PAB what has happened. Your description will be recorded and sent to either an SAC or CareLine.
3. **WAIT** for SAC or CareLine staff to respond to you or visit your house to provide assistance.

### Success Stories

PABs have been installed in more than 6,000 housing units from 53 rental blocks.

Between November 2019 and September 2021, the PAB handled 415 emergency cases, including medical, social, and crime-related issues. Hear testimonies from two PAB users:

_“From 9pm to 3am… my leg was so painful. I couldn’t get out of bed… I can’t walk so I pressed the button for help. My son lives in Woodlands, too far away from me. I would have taken a taxi ride to hospital myself, but at 3am… where can I find a taxi?”_ 
**- Mdm A, a senior who lives alone**

_“I was feeling breathless, I can’t reach the phone. I can’t even tell the 995 phone operator my address even if I can walk to my phone. [Your system] no need to give address, they knew… and they sent the ambulance to me.”_ 
**– Mr T, a senior who lives alone**

### What's Next?

The team is exploring opportunities to deploy the PAB beyond the 53 rental blocks.
