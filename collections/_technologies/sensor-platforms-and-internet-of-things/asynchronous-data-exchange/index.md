## Asynchronous Data Exchange (ADEX)

### Overview

**Asynchronous Data Exchange (ADEX)** platform is the solution to unlock the universe of whole-of-government (WOG) real-time data, asynchronous fire-and-forget data transfer. With ADEX’s data marketplace, agencies can browse all datasets across WOG for sharing. ADEX will work not only with sensor, but also non-sensor and streaming data.

ADEX enables government agencies to publish and subscribe to real-time data using a self-service portal that will run in Government Commercial Cloud (GCC) both internet and intranet.

Agencies can either connect via intranet through the SGWAN interface or via MPLS from their private network. Agencies can use ADEX to discover and share event data such as status updates or event streams in real-time, across internet and intranet. Subscribers will receive updates as soon as the events are published. Publishers can choose who will be able to subscribe.

This diagram shows the components of ADEX and its ability to distribute real-time data across networks.

### What is ADEX for?

- **ASYNCHRONOUS DATA EXCHANGE (ADEX) FOR WOG** 

  ADEX is a platform for real-time, asynchronous fire-and-forget data transfer. 

- **PROVIDES DATA SHARING MARKETPLACE** 

  With ADEX's data marketplace, agencies can browse all datasets across the whole-of-government for sharing. 

- **OFFERS CENTRAL EXCHANGE SERVICE TO FACILITATE SHARING** 

   ADEX enables agencies to publish and subscribe to real-time data using a self-service portal along with workflow engine. It helps to secure data across network zones eliminating diverse protocols and interfaces.  

- **CREATES CATALYST FOR DISCOVERY AND INNOVATION** 

  ADEX creates a culture of sharing for collaboration and innovation across the public service with potential use cases discovery for new services.
