  The LaaP project trials the effectiveness of lampposts as a key sensor infrastructure for a smart city.
---

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  As a commonplace feature of our urban environment, lampposts are reliable power sources that provide lighting in our city. The LaaP project uses lampposts as a key sensor infrastructure to deploy different kinds of intelligent sensors and network connectivity technologies for a smart city. 
</p>
<p>
  LaaP offers a common infrastructure and services for the various Government agencies to collect, share and analyse real-time sensor and video data. Sensor data from the LaaP platform can provide situational awareness to augment the operational and planning capabilities of the agencies.
</p>
<p>
  LaaP is part of the Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP), a whole-of-government (WOG) technology platform that transforms sensor data into a 360° situational awareness of smart city spaces in Singapore. LaaP is a component of the Sensor Data layer of the SNSP Framework (SNSP’s tech stack) and functions as a smart infrastructure, creating smarter city spaces across Singapore with real-time sensor data.
</p>

<h2>What is LaaP?</h2>

<p>
  LaaP uses cloud-based infrastructure, wired and wireless technologies (e.g. low-bandwidth, low-powered wide area network connectivity). It is also fitted with intelligent sensors - including video, environmental and geolocation sensors.
</p>
<p>
  These capabilities help agencies translate sensor data, both within their domain of expertise and across multiple domains, by providing them with greater situational awareness and actionable insights for operations and planning.
</p>
<p>
  Key LaaP features are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Centralised device management</strong>: LaaP provides a centralised device management platform to monitor and manage the health status and configuration of devices at deployment sites.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Video/sensor data acquisition</strong>: LaaP supports various messaging protocols and connectivity to securely acquire sensor and video data from deployment sites.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Video/sensor data analytics</strong>: Sensor nodes at the edge fuse multiple sources of sensor data, with support for both front-end edge analytics and back-end video analytics.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Support for different Internet of Things (IoT) protocols</strong>: LaaP supports protocols such as DDS and MQTT.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>End-to-end security</strong>: LaaP uses secure end-to-end encryption to prevent data from being read or modified, other than by the true sender(s) and recipient(s).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Should LaaP be Adopted?</h2>

<p>
  LaaP can be used as a common sensor infrastructure to provide better situational awareness about the physical environment in which each lamppost is located.
</p>

<b>Localised Environment Monitoring</b>
<p>
  LaaP uses environmental sensors to collect localised environmental data such as temperature, humidity, the concentration of different gases, air quality, and rainfall.
</p>
<p>
  These localised environmental data enable agencies to design better living and workspaces around environmental factors and promote public health and environmental sustainability.
