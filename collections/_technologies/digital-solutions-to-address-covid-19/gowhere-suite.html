<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  GoWhere Suite is a ground-up initiative by GovTech’s Government Digital Services (GDS) team. It was created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and addresses the need for a rapid and reliable source of information. It also supports location/eligibility-based information queries/discoveries, functions as an inclusive mass media channel and provides OpsTech integration to support Government distribution operations. Currently, GoWhere Suite exists as a mini-stack, featuring various Government portals and has been used in 14 Government initiatives which boosts 25.4 million website visits.

<h2>Why Should GoWhere Suite be Adopted?</h2>

<p>
  GoWhere Suite is a one-stop resource hub for all official COVID-19 related information. By consolidating COVID-19 related resources in one website, Singapore residents can efficiently and quickly obtain accurate information. Besides English, GoWhere Suite can also be adapted to Chinese, Malay or Tamil this increases its mass appeal as residents who are more proficient in their Mother Tongue can utilise the website too. The various search functions present also prevents users from scrolling through multiple sites, tabs and portals. Misleading or false information can also be cross-checked against the information present on GoWhere Suite or through the contact points present on the various sites.
</p>

<p>
  Here are some of the services that Gowhere has been offering during the
  crisis:
</p>

<h3>Tokengowhere</h3>

<p>
  The latest addition to the Gowhere suite, <a href="https://token.gowhere.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
    ><u>Tokengowhere</u></a
  > directs citizens to
  their nearest collection points for the TraceTogether Token when they enter
  their postal code in the search bar. The site also provides care instructions
  for the token.
</p>
<p>

  >.
</p>

<h3>Maskgowhere</h3>

<figure style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/assets/img/Maskgowhere.png" alt="A screenshot of the Maskgowhere page">
</figure>

<p>
  When the Singapore Government announced that masks would be distributed to
  every household in Singapore, a group of developers started work on a website
  to assist with the distribution, in collaboration with People’s Association
  (PA). Maskgowhere’s concept is simple: citizens enter their postal code in the
  search bar to retrieve information on their nearest mask collection points.
  Maskgowhere has supported several rounds of mask distributions, and has been
  enhanced with features to display mask vending machine stock levels as well
  as a multilingual poster generator feature to support PA’s needs (see
  Postergowhere below for more information).

<h3>Supportgowhere</h3>

<figure style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/assets/img/Supportgowhere.png" alt="A screenshot of the Supportgowhere page">
</figure>

<p>
  With so many new COVID-19 support schemes, grants and packages being
  introduced by the Government, citizens might find it hard to keep track
  of the most relevant initiatives that could tide them through these trying
  times. Supportgowhere was built as a user-friendly site that compiles all
  these schemes on one site. It has an eligibility checker feature that helps
  give citizens clarity on schemes they may be eligible for, so they need not
  sift through the schemes one by one, which can be time-consuming and
  confusing.
</p>

<h3>Flugowhere</h3>

<figure style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/assets/img/Flugowhere.png" alt="A screenshot of the Fluegowhere page">
</figure>

<p>
  The concept for Flugowhere is similar to Maskgowhere’s, where citizens enter
  their postal code into the search bar to generate a list of Public Health
  Preparedness Clinics (PHPC) near them. Clinic opening hours, swabbing hours
  and information on healthcare subsidies are also listed on the site.
</p>

<h3>VoteQgowhere</h3>

<figure style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/assets/img/Voteqgowhere.png" alt="A screenshot of VoteQgowhere page">
</figure>

<p>
  During the General Elections held in July 2020, there was a strong need for
  crowd management measures at polling stations to minimise the risk of COVID-19
  transmission within the community. In this context, VoteQgowhere was built in
  collaboration with the Elections Department (ELD). Like Maskgowhere and
  Flugowhere, voters can enter their postal code to retrieve information about
  their assigned polling station, such as the exact address and the number of
  people currently in the queue. This helped voters to avoid joining
  already-crowded polling stations and only do so when the queues were
  shorter.
</p>

<h3>Reactgowhere</h3>

<figure style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/assets/img/Gowherelibrary.png" alt="A screenshot of the Reactgowhere page">
</figure>

<p>
  To facilitate the design and development of the services in the Gowhere suite,
  a reusable, portable and rigorously tested design-system library was created.
  For each new service deployed, the team can monitor user experience and
  consider the improvements that can be made based on feedback received from the
  live sites. This iterative approach allows the team to continuously improve
  the different Gowhere services. The design-system library also streamlines the
  development of new Gowhere services.
</p>

<h3>Postergowhere</h3>

<figure style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/assets/img/Postergowhere.png" alt="A screenshot of the Postergowhere tool">
</figure>

<p>
  Every mask distribution exercise is extremely ops-heavy. One of the tasks for
  such exercises involves tedious data entry and populating the website with
  information, and another task involves communicating and notifying citizens of
  upcoming distributions.
</p>
<p>
  To make these tasks less labour-intensive, the GoWhere team and PA
  collaborated to build a poster generator tool that creates standardised
  multilingual posters with the most up-to-date information of the distribution
  exercise. The information entered into these posters is reflected on the
  GoWhere distribution websites (e.g. Maskgowhere or Tokengowhere)
  simultaneously, condensing two separate tasks into one. This tool is the
  secret ingredient behind each Gowhere site’s success as a reliable source of
  truth for citizens.
