  SPOTON - Smart Thermal Scanning
</h2>
<p>
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SPOTON was developed by GovTech’s <a href="/technologies/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things"> Smart Nation Platform Solutions (SNPS)</a> team to conduct temperature screening in areas with high traffic. Due to lacking manpower or infrastructure, it can be difficult to conduct temperature screening in high traffic areas, such as malls.
</p>
<p>
  These problems can be resolved with SPOTON, as fast crowd temperature screening is enabled by detecting and
  alerting operators to individuals with high temperatures.
  This minimises physical contact and time spent on manual temperature checks.
