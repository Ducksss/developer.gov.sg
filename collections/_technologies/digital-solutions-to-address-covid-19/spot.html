<h2>
  SPOT - Safe Distancing Robot
</h2>
<p>
  A four-legged robot that was trialled at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park to assist safe
  distancing efforts at parks, gardens and nature reserves managed by NParks and
  for delivery of essential items like medicine to patients in Changi Exhibition
  Centre (CEC) community isolation facility.
</p>
<p>
  At Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, SPOT helped estimate the number of visitors in the
  park and broadcasted a recorded message reminding park visitors to observe
  safe distancing measures. With SPOT's remote navigation capabilities, this
  helped reduce the manpower needed for park patrols, reducing physical contact
  among staff, safe distancing ambassadors and park visitors, and in turn
  lowering their risk of exposure to the COVID-19 virus.
</p>
<p>
  GovTech's Digital Operations Smart Services (DOSS) platform provided the 
  software capabilities that enabled SPOT's use for safe distancing. These
  capabilities include Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) control, autonomous
  navigation and people counting using deep learning.
