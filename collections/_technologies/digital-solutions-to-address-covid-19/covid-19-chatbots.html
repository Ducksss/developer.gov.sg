<h2>
COVID-19 ChatBot for Citizens
</h2>
<p>
These online ChatBots provide timely and accurate answers based on their programmed
knowledge base. The knowledge base is collected from past user enquiries as well
as frequently asked questions prescribed by MCI. The ChatBots also help to
disseminate relevant policy guidelines when needed.
</p>
<p>
There are 2 citizen-facing chatbots developed for COVID-19. The first is the
Web version <a href ="https://www.gov.sg/infobot">here.</a>

This allows the public to select the relevant content from a list of topics on a
dropdown menu. From there, the ChatBot will redirect the user to the relevant
website where necessary. This ChatBot is available in English only.
<p>
The second is the WhatsApp version which pushes daily notifications out to the
public who subscribed at <a href="https://www.gov.sg/article/govsg-on-whatsapp">go.gov.sg/whatsapp.</a>
This chatbot provides a list of latest fact checks, tips to fight misinformation and even
find fact-checkers near you. It is also available in the 4 official langauges - Chinese,

The WhatsApp-based COVID-19 ChatBot is developed using GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
Serverless Computing using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
stack. The connection to WhatsApp is done through an API (Application Programming Interface)
provided from Facebook. The ChatBot also includes a spam filter to handle subscribers
who have an Auto-reply function enabled.
