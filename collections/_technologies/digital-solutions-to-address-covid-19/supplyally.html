<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  The COVID-19 pandemic produced an urgent need to address logistical challenges on a national scale. For example, the distribution of reusable face masks to all Singapore residents created a logistical challenge to track collection quotas and to manage a flexible pool of volunteers.
</p>
<p>
  In response to these urgent logistical challenges, GovTechâ€™s Government Digital Services (GDS) team developed SupplyAlly, a mobile app to facilitate nationwide logistics distributions.
