### Overview

SGFinDex was developed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) in collaboration with The Association of Banks in Singapore and seven participating banks to provide a simple solution to a complicated problem. 

In Singapore, where individuals have accounts with multiple financial institutions (FIs), it is a challenge for them to transfer their personal financial data held by each FI to another FI or the Government. Private sector FIs, such as banks and insurance companies, have historically faced challenges in sharing data with other entities due to a lack of common data standards and interoperability between platforms. 

The SGFinDex team believed that an opportunity presented itself amidst these circumstances and SGFinDex was hence developed as the world’s first public digital infrastructure for retrieval of financial data across agencies, built on Singapore's National Digital Identity (Singpass) infrastructure and a centrally managed online consent system.

### What is SGFinDex?

The Singapore Financial Data Exchange (SGFinDex) is the world's first public digital infrastructure to use a national digital identity and **centrally managed online consent system** to enable individuals to access, through applications, their financial information held across different government agencies and financial institutions. 

During the second phase launch, individuals are now able to view information on their investment holdings at The Central Depository (CDP) as part of their consolidated financial position via participating banks’ financial planning applications and MyMoneySense, a free government financial planning digital service.

In the next phase of SGFinDex, individuals will be able to access information on their insurance policies held with insurers.

### Why Should SGFinDex be Adopted?

Awarded with the Most Innovative Use of Data for Digital Transformation award at the [INSPIRE Tech Awards 2021](https://cioacademyasia.org/inspire-tech-awards-2021/){:target="\_blank"}, SGFinDex illustrates the importance of public-private sector collaborations, consent-based data-driven innovations, and trusted online systems.

The developers of SGFinDex also takes great pride in the following features and principles that drives the development of SGFinDex: 	

-	**Highly scalable national infrastructure**: Powered by the National Digital Identity tech stack, the public digital infrastructure of SGFinDex can be extended and replicated to other industries beyond the finance sector.

-	**Consent-driven retrievals facilitated by integrated consuming applications**: Financial data can be retrieved only through explicit consent of the individual, whose identity must be verified through SingPass.

-	**Data privacy**: SGFinDex is designed to ensure data protection and privacy of personal financial information. SGFinDex will only transmit but neither store nor read the user’s personal financial data.

-	**Data encryption**: Users’ personal financial data is encrypted when it is retrieved through SGFinDex. Only the financial planning application/website that the user has authorised to receive the data is able to decrypt it.
