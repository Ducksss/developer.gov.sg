### Overview

SGFinDex was developed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) in collaboration with The Association of Banks in Singapore and seven participating banks to provide a simple solution to a complicated problem. 

In Singapore, where individuals have accounts with multiple financial institutions (FIs), it is a challenge for them to transfer their personal financial data held by each FI to another FI or the Government. Private sector FIs, such as banks and insurance companies, have historically faced challenges in sharing data with other entities due to a lack of common data standards and interoperability between platforms. 

The SGFinDex team believed that an opportunity presented itself amidst these circumstances and SGFinDex was hence developed as the worldâ€™s first public digital infrastructure for retrieval of financial data across agencies, built on Singapore's National Digital Identity (Singpass) infrastructure and a centrally managed online consent system.
