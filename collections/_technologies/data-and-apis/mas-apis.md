  The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) provides APIs for developers, allowing MAS’ applications to be streamlined.

## Overview

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) provides Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for developers to access relevant data from MAS and make use of the datasets for streamlining of applications and systems. For instance, companies can make use of MAS’ exchange rate APIs to automate the extraction of exchange rates for tax filing with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore; software developers could use MAS’ interest rates data to illustrate interest rates trends.

MAS’ APIs are just one of the many datasets and APIs that the Singapore Government Developer Portal provides for developers to link their products with Government data and services.
