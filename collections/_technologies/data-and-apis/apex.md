### Overview

Singapore’s Smart Nation vision places an emphasis on digital innovation as a driver of economic progress. Following this, the public sector has consistently driven growth in digital technologies in order to better serve our citizens. Data being a central pillar of digital technologies and transformation, has since increased in importance as it helps to inform policy changes and reviews, decision making, and facilitate the development of citizen-centric digital products and services.

The increasing role of data driven decision making has in turn increased the need for a centralised and secure data sharing platform for the government. Thus, leading to the development of GovTech’s APEX, a self-service API platform that acts as a centralised and secure API gateway for the government. On APEX, users can easily publish, monitor, and discover APIs across government agencies securely.

### What is APEX?

APEX can be thought of as a centralised data sharing platform within the government. It enables convenient and secure data sharing through the use of APIs which contain coded rules that manages who has access to the data and how data gets transferred.

In addition to secure data sharing, APEX’s API catalogue provides government agencies with a searchable library of government APIs. This promotes knowledge sharing within the government, while reducing digital silos and the duplication of efforts.

The central logging system of APEX also provides an overview of all API call logs, this allows agencies to troubleshoot issues when necessary.

The central administration dashboard of APEX serves as a monitoring tool for system health checks and provides analytics.  

Other key features of APEX include its self-service model, provision of professional services, ability to support multi-tenanted Environments and modern RESTful and SOAP APIs.
