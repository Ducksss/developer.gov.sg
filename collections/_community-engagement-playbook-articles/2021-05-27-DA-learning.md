**The Digital Academy**, which aims to strengthen the digital competencies of Public Officers, is now available to Whole-of-Government following
its soft launch in January 2021 to GovTech and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO).

Agencies can leverage this “Practitioner-for-Practitioner” academy to **upskill and deepen officers’ capabilities based on the ICT&SS Competency Framework**. The Academy will offer **55 programmes across several domains**, including Data Science & AI, Infrastructure & Architecture and Cybersecurity. The full suite of courses will be available by the end of March 2022. 

Since February 2021, The Digital Academy has conducted inaugural runs of several courses, such as [Certified Scrum Product Owner](https://thedigitalacademy.tech.gov.sg/course/detail/TDA-certified-scrum-product-owner) and [Evaluating Software Architecture](https://thedigitalacademy.tech.gov.sg/course/detail/evaluating-software--architecture). The courses were well received, and upcoming runs are now available for registration. ICT professionals interested in tech upskilling may wish to explore similar courses under the Applications Development domain.
