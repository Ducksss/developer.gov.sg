### Overview

The Accreditation@SGD programme was launched in July 2014 by the [Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)](https://www.imda.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} to grow and nurture the local Infocomm Media (ICM) ecosystem. Through Accreditation@SGD, Singapore-based ICM companies can establish credentials, build business traction, grow and compete in the global market as more opportunities are created for their products to be showcased and bought. For buyers from the Government and large enterprises, the accreditation process provides an independent third-party evaluation of these ICM companies’ claimed product core functionalities and ability to deliver.

Accreditation@SGD contributes to Singapore’s ICM sector by promoting the next generation of digital expertise and business. This is aligns with Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative and is a key contributor to Singapore’s Digital Economy Strategy.

### What is Accreditation@SGD?

Accreditation@SGD grows and nurtures the local system by:
- Accrediting promising and innovative high-growth ICM companies to establish their credentials and position them as qualified contenders.

-	Building an innovative technopreneur ecosystem that inspires the younger generation. Leading to the development of more innovative products and tech product companies that can enter overseas markets.

Since March 2019, the SecureTech track has also been launched in partnership with the [Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA)](https://www.csa.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} to improve the quality of local cybersecurity technologies.

### How Do You Get Accredited?

Fig 1 provides a summary of the accreditation process which begins with an application from companies. Thereafter, companies are shortlisted and evaluated based on financial, operational and technical criteria which can be viewed in detail in Fig 2. Once accreditation has been awarded, it will be valid for 18 months and companies will be subjected to routine reviews. Renewal of the accreditation will be done through evaluation of the company’s financial, operational and technical aspects without the need to go through the application and shortlisting process again. 

Guidelines on the accreditation process can be found [here](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/www.imda.gov.sg/-/media/Imda/Files/Programme/AccreditationSGD/Accreditation-SGD-Guidelines.pdf){:target="_blank"} and the Terms and Conditions can be accessed through this [link.](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/www.imda.gov.sg/-/media/Imda/Files/Programme/AccreditationSGD/Accreditation-TCsV5.pdf){:target="_blank"} For cybersecurity companies interested in the SecureTech track, more details of the application process can be found [here.](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/www.imda.gov.sg/-/media/Imda/Files/Industry-Development/Startups/Accreditation-SecureTech-GuidelinesV1.pdf){:target="_blank"}
