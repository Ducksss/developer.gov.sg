<h2>What is UX Design?</h2>
<p>
    UX design is a process that emphasises how users interact with and experience your product or service. As a discipline, UX is made up of several domains which entail different job scopes and roles, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Design Researcher</b>: Performs primary and secondary research on user behaviours, needs and goals for the design of your product.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Interaction Designer</b>: Defines how people will interact with your product, and how to elicit the desired user behaviour, responses, and outcomes.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Content Strategist/UX Writer</b>: Defines how information should be structured, so that the content is easy to navigate.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Service Designer: Creates a seamless experience that meets the needs of your users by tying together human, digital, and physical interactions.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why is UX Design Important?</h2>
<p>
    User interaction with a product or service is affected by the user’s individual characteristics and the usage context. Therefore, a product or service has to serve different needs based on individual preferences and context.
</p>
<p>
    For example, a smartphone navigation app will be useful for someone who is technology literate but not for someone who is technology illiterate. A good UX design also strives to meet the relevant user’s needs in their respective usage context.
</p>
<p>
    UX design is thus important to help you create a product or service that is meaningful and impactful to your users.
