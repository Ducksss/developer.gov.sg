  title: Embracing a Brave New World of Technology – A Government Journey
  desc: Many large organisations have been quickly overtaken by the rapid progress of technology around them, and this is no exception for governments around the world. Venturing into the brave new world of technology is like a young person leaving home for the first time. It is full of freedom, excitement and anxiety, It is also full of risks, fear and uncertainties. Ignoring technology like Cloud, SaaS, full stack, etc., is no longer an option. The days of building bespoke monolithic systems from scratch is risky, costly and wasteful. The new world is about reusability, iterations and automation. It’s about talent, culture and design. The Singapore Government, like everyone else, needs to embrace this brave new world or risk becoming irrelevant.

  title: Changed Responsibilities in Modern Software Development Environments
  desc: "With business increasing the pressure and demand for flexibility of development teams, the agile movement was pushed to the limit. CI/CD was born to reduce manual steps and the errors that arise from them, as well as increase the speed of going live. With DevOps, the teams also took on application responsibilities, from cradle to grave. Nevertheless, software security is still missing in many full-stack developers' resumes and application security responsibilities are still pushed off to the security department. This is a real pity, because agile, CI/CD and DevOps are security-enabling practices. This session explains Shift-left and early security enablement in the development lifecycle. As the application development becomes more developer-centric, the developer’s toolset must include new capabilities to match the new challenges. Learn about rugged software and supply chain cleanliness, and how to avoid the common pitfalls of modern application development strategies. Hear why security champions programmes tend to fail, compliance-driven security training is a waste of time and money, and why security teams struggle and fail to integrate security tooling in release pipelines. Take back the best practices, proven solutions and Shift Left beyond the development."

  title: Simplifying Data and AI with Lakehouse Platforms
  desc: "Traditionally, building data and AI applications in most enterprises has been complex because data is stored and processed across many disparate systems: data lakes such as Amazon S3, SQL data warehouses, message bus systems, and others. Enterprises have to staff large data engineering projects to move data across these systems, and end-users experience long delays and reliability problems. In the past few years, the cloud and open source have enabled a new class of data platform that unifies data lakes and warehouses, the lakehouse, and makes it significantly easier to share data across an organisation for all use cases. Because these platforms use open source formats, they are also directly usable in AI and streaming applications. I will describe how lakehouse systems such as the open source Delta Lake project, and how Databricks customers are using the lakehouse to achieve unprecedented scale and operational simplicity across analytics and AI use cases."

  title: Navigating Cybersecurity in the Digital Darkness
  desc: As the Singapore government embarks on a massive digitalisation journey, there is also an increasing awareness about the importance of cybersecurity - the foundation of digital trust for our government's services. With awareness of it growing, cybersecurity has been said to be one of the biggest reasons why digitalisation is getting more expensive. This prompted me to investigate further to understand why. When we dove deeper, I came to realise that the biggest problem is that everyone wants to provide a solution even when we are not sure what the problem really is. It is akin to navigating cybersecurity in the digital darkness. By the end of this presentation, I hope to empower attendees on how to identify and avoid artificial constraints, think more critically about cybersecurity threats, and implement simpler systems and operations for better security performance.

  title: "Improving Government Services with Data: Best Practices, Tips and Insights from WOGAA"
  desc: "Singaporeans’ love for the internet is undeniable. According to a 2020 study, almost 90% of the population uses the internet, with an average time spent of 8 hours a day. With such a high internet penetration rate, providing a good web browsing experience to consumers is paramount. What are some of the factors contributing to a good digital experience? In terms of usability, the website must be readily available, load quickly and is easily searchable, so as to deliver its intended outcome to users of all demographics and abilities in a simple and efficient manner. At the same time, as we strive towards becoming a more inclusive society, web accessibility is also becoming a major priority, to make sure that a person with disabilities or physical limitations has equal access to the content like the rest of the online community. Over the years, the Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA) has developed services to help agencies have a better grasp of how their digital services are performing, as the Singapore government strives towards the Digital Government Blueprint’s goal of becoming a \"digital-to-the-core Government that serves with heart\". In this presentation, we hope to shed more light on how WOGAA helps to drive agencies to achieve excellence in areas such as usability, digital service availability and web content accessibility. This includes initiatives such as the Digital Service Awards, which provides positive reinforcement to motivate public officers to improve their digital services, as well as the Digital Service Dashboard, incorporating a set of KPIs to nudge agencies to achieve service excellence in areas such as Web Accessibility and Search Engine Optimisation. As Steve Jobs once said, \"If a user is having a problem, it's our problem.\" We hope that service owners recognise that usability is a shared responsibility among all stakeholders of a product, and through this presentation, audiences can learn about best practices and gain useful tips on how to better leverage WOGAA to improve their digital services to benefit their end users.<br><br>Theme: Government Track"

  title: "Unlocking Engineering Productivity through Unlimited Isolated Test Environments"
  desc: "As cloud adoption within an organisation increases, it is only natural for engineering teams to start adopting more managed services. Over time, as the complexity of the cloud tech stack grows, it becomes increasingly hard, if not impossible, to replicate the production environment on a developer’s device or even in a shared location. At best, organisations maintain a couple of \"dev\" and \"staging\" environments that they try to keep as similar to \"production\" as possible. The challenge imposed by these handfuls of shared environments is that they become bottlenecks to delivery with multiple engineering teams jostling for their use. At Endowus, we went through a similar journey. Thus, in this session, we will share how we overcame this challenge by building an internal service to rapidly provide isolated \"production-like\" environments that enable parallel testing and deliveries by multiple engineering teams. By combining the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with on-demand cloud infrastructure and managed services, we will demonstrate how we manage the lifecycle of these environments exposed through self-service APIs to provide a great platform experience to our development teams. We will also cover how we are now integrating this capability with our automated testing infrastructure to further accelerate our deliveries.<br><br>Theme: Beyond Cloud"

  title: "Develop Resilient Applications for Lean Operations"
  desc: "In an increasingly manpower-lean operating environment, it is essential to design and develop applications that are resilient and minimise manpower efforts to monitor and mediate service interruptions.<br><br>Application requirements have changed and escalated drastically over the past decade and more so with the advent of cloud. A fail-safe app development will need to employ techniques and methodology from multiple disciplines.<br><br>For example, there is a plethora of different frameworks and approaches to building resilient applications:<br>1. System Reliability Engineering (SRE). This seeks to take a data-driven approach, with feedback for continuous improvement decisions.<br>2. DevSecOps with SHIP-HATS. This seeks to have a holistic approach to chain the activities from development, security to operations so that there are no gaps left behind to achieve a quality system that is ‘fail-safe’ to security vulnerability.<br>3. Architecture approaches such as Reactive architecture seek to be responsive, elastic, resilient, and message-driven.<br>4. Build compliant and cost-effective solutions by moving up skill levels in cloud adoption maturity with Containerisation, serverless solutions to minimise maintenance overheads, and IaC for automation maximisation.<br>5. Importantly, how do we align to WOG-level SGTS services, and direction including authentication – WOG AD/AAD/CAM, GTBA.<br>6. And, there is of course what I would call ‘common sense’ – foundations of computer science that are irrespective of the technologies that will be employed to build resilience of systems; such as the handling distributed transactions, respecting what constitute global state.<br><br>In this talk, we seek to un-tangle the different approaches, which are all correct because they come from different stakeholder’s perspective. But how do we tie them together? What are the practical practice-able things that can be done to achieve ‘Fail-safe application development’? This is what this talk will share and will be interesting to seek feedback from practitioners from the audience in the session.<br><br>Theme: Fail-Safe App Development"

  title: "DevSecOps Driven Workload to Workload Zero Trust to Detect Advanced Threats"
  desc: "MITRE ATT&CK framework offers a taxonomy that can be used to describe any attack. This is very useful as we discuss the structure of an advanced attack that has multiple stages and is executed over time as a succession of achievement of tactical goals. In our research we notice that adoption of Zero Trust principles (assume breach, explicitly verify, use least privilege, continually assess), orchestrated by DevSecOps, the chances of detecting execution of procedures that employ techniques for carrying out a tactical goal, increase significantly. A study of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) carried out by use of Sunburst, a malware that was employed in the Solarigate attacks, shows that the most relevant zero trust principles whose adoption would help in detecting the TTPs are ‘assume breach’ and ‘continually assess’. Signals generated by activities of threat modeling, SAST, DAST, Pen Testing and additional techniques to observe process level characteristics and communication profiles of workloads during the development phase of the software development lifecycle, allow development of a baseline against which anomalies can be detected via continuous monitoring in runtime during the operational phase of the cycle. Machine Learning assisted contextual analysis of anomalies help identify TTPs and generate a risk score which is used to take an appropriate mitigation action. In our talk we discuss practical ways for leveraging DevSecOps to follow zero trust principles of ‘assume breach’ and ‘continually assess’, in order to detect TTPs thwarting hackers' attempts to reach their tactical goals.<br><br>Theme: Building Digital Trust"

  title: "Building a Distributed Data Mesh with a DevOps Approach"
  desc: "Applications have moved from being traditional monoliths to microservice services driven architecture. Similarly, data platforms are facing that transitional moment and the advent of a distributed data mesh is the data platform or microservices. Originated from Zhamak Dehghani, a ThoughtWorks consultant, a distributed data mesh is a platform architecture that supports distributed, data-specific domains and serves \"data-as-a-product\" owned and managed by different domain owners. This in turn enables data sharing between different domains across an organization with more feasibility and flexibility.<br><br>To build a distributed data mesh, similar to how we build microservices, good DevOps practices must be in place in order to help iterate through changes and deploy updates quickly. For example, how do we efficiently deploy our data code? How do we manage different data environments across domains? Is it possible to create reproducible pipelines and infrastructure through an automated fashion?<br><br>We will look at how<br>a) using a data platform such as Snowflake extends a Data Mesh approach by enabling domains to not only share data as product but also processing logic as product.<br>b) we embed DevOps tools (such as Jenkin, Terraform) and open source transformation tools (such as DBT and Apache Airflow) to build elastic data pipelines, repeatable infrastructure and scalable data products.<br>c) governance is enforced within each domain and propagated downstream.<br><br>Theme: Datafication"

  title: "Design Thinking in DevOps"
  desc: "Let’s automate everything! Sounds familiar? Automation is indeed the fundamental of DevOps to improve software delivery performance across the build, test and deployment stages. However, automation is a double-edged sword, without a proper planning and a well-defined process, the results can be disastrous or there can be no result at all. Developing automation in DevOps is not as straightforward as saying \"let’s automate everything\" because it may involve different tools and processes for different stages. Although we very much hope that these tools are plug-and-play, there is no one-size-fits-all process so we need a team, typically DevOps/SRE engineers, to develop tool-specific scripts. Why is it so challenging to automate everything despite a strong push for automation in DevOps? Automation development is similar to product development in some ways. Although the goal is to improve software delivery performance, the main beneficiaries are the developers and operations team because it offloads them from repetitive and mundane tasks. So whether the automation eventually gets implemented in production, it really depends on them. If the automation is not going to help them in any ways, you’ll see all your efforts in the bin. Or, if they’re asking for something not realistic, it’s not going to benefit anyone as well so sometimes it’s not because of the technology but the human element that’s hindering the automation development. This is where Design Thinking comes into play. You’ll learn the practical adoption of Design Thinking and how we use it to approach automation development. By the end of the session, we can all call ourselves Automation Designers (if you pay attention and grasp the concept well).<br><br>Theme: Fail-Safe App Development"

  title: "Building a Robust Threat Detection System for Social Engineered Cyber Threats"
  desc: "In 2021, cyber criminals impersonating OCBC Bank through text messages successfully scammed hundreds of Singaporeans of their life savings. In May ‘22, the FBI reported up to $43 billion dollars of business losses to cyber criminals due to similar social engineered attacks between 2016 and 2021. Instead of a spray and pray method where the same attack is sent to multiple users, cyber criminals are now pivoting to highly targeted social engineered attacks. They attempt to gain your trust by impersonating someone you already know or trust - your manager, your colleagues etc. They then aim to trick you into executing the cyber attack, be it running malware, providing your credentials or sending money to a fake bank account. However, legacy security solutions that have defended us against cyber threats are built on brittle rules and threat intelligence feeds - this lends them to perform poorly against these zero day, hyper targeted attacks. In order to solve these emerging threats, one would need a completely new approach - we propose that a behavioral detection engine with modern ML techniques would deliver a solution with both higher recall and precision. In place of building lists of \"known bad\" entities, we propose first building profiles of what is considered normal within user environments. Machine Learning models trained to detect deviations against this baseline understanding of normality are then capable of differentiating attacker vs safe user behavior with a higher level of accuracy. I am a founding engineer at Abnormal Security, a next-gen Email Security startup. I’ve spent the last four years building this behavioral detection engine that aims to detect all types of malicious emails, especially socially engineered email attacks (e.g. sending a Fake Invoice while impersonating a Vendor). In my proposed talk, I will discuss the unique parameters of modern cybersecurity attacks in relation to machine learning, particularly the adversarial nature of the problem and how it shows up in data and model performance. Using the email security problem as an example, I will then discuss the requirements of a robust threat detection system, describing how both ML and software systems are required to solve cyberthreats in different time horizons. I will then focus on our machine learning stack, discussing how we incorporate the behavioral detection approach with our feature aggregation engine, the various components of ML solution and their various results.<br><br>Theme: Building Digital Trust"

  desc: "A Smart Nation is built together with her citizens. However, despite the rapid adoption of technology amongst the people, agencies still find it challenging to engage the nation not only at scale but also in an operationally efficient manner, and harness the power of the collective intelligence of the crowd. From citizens with specialised skill sets to the ideas and feedback of the general public, the citizens of a nation in collaboration with the government presents as an untapped mine of possibilities. Following in the footsteps of successful brands and companies, gamification is a concept that has been used to engage customers and fans on a global scale with much success. Regardless of age, culture or language, play is a term that is widely understood by the crowd and is an effective tool to drive meaningful engagement with an audience. At Crowdtask.sg, we believe that gamification can be the spark that drives the ethos of a more engaged nation. We are excited to share the different ways gamification can help shape the behavior of the nation, where the ultimate goal is to have citizens intrinsically motivated to engage with agencies to build better products and policies.
