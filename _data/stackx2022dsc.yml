  title: Analytics by Design
  desc: Analytics-readiness is something that all projects should have on Day 1 of its launch. The key to that is to avoid analytics debt. The data collected from policy implementations, or programme executions should address questions that will help finetune refinements down the road. The data generated from products and platforms should help inform how well it is working, and what new features to build, or what to tweak. But this is often not the reality. Many projects face challenges with analytics downstream, potentially leading to disappointments from both from the business side, as well as the data science practitioners. In this sharing, the speaker will share more about Analytics By Design, which is a methodology that GovTech had mooted, and is piloting internally.
