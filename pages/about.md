### Singapore Government Developer Portal: Our Journey Thus Far

In early 2020, we began work on the Singapore Government Developer Portal, a site originally meant to serve the internal 
[Government Digital Services](https://hive.tech.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} team in GovTech. As it happens, there is a vast catalogue of Government digital 
products and services and, at the time, we found that many teams across the public sector just didn’t know enough about each others’ services to leverage them. 
This was a problem because the solutions that many teams needed had already been developed, but simply remained undiscovered by them!

By gathering information and documentation about all these services and placing them in one central, convenient portal, we hoped to break down information 
barriers and generate a greater synergy across the public sector. We are lucky to have support from our senior leadership CE Ping Soon and 
GCDTO Cheow Hoe in driving adoption of the portal and setting the direction that all of GovTech’s product developer portals should be accessed from the 
developer portal.

As we continued to work on the developer portal to fulfil that original vision, it also became clear that it was now the logical channel through which we 
could engage our burgeoning community. After all, our community building efforts were driven by the same underlying desire to break down information 
barriers - especially barriers to Government products and services - as well as to create a space for knowledge to be shared.

### A Year On

Today, the developer portal is the one-stop resource site for developers and other technology professionals to discover and evaluate Government products, access useful Government guidelines and policies, follow standards and best practices to achieve consistency across a wide range of Government products, as well as find technical documentation through our documentation service, which can be accessed through this [link](https://docs.developer.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}.

We have published information on over 50 products and are continuing to publish more, such as information on the 
[Singapore Government Tech Stack](/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview/){:target="_blank"} (SGTS) - a common platform that streamlines and simplifies the development process for government agencies. With SGTS, agencies will be able to utilise a suite of tools and services hosted on a common infrastructure to ensure consistency and high quality in their applications. Another popular request from our partners is the Government Instruction Manual, which we are proud to say is also available on the [developer portal](/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/im8){:target="_blank"}.
