### Singapore Government Developer Portal: Our Journey Thus Far

In early 2020, we began work on the Singapore Government Developer Portal, a site originally meant to serve the internal 
[Government Digital Services](https://hive.tech.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} team in GovTech. As it happens, there is a vast catalogue of Government digital 
products and services and, at the time, we found that many teams across the public sector just didn’t know enough about each others’ services to leverage them. 
This was a problem because the solutions that many teams needed had already been developed, but simply remained undiscovered by them!

By gathering information and documentation about all these services and placing them in one central, convenient portal, we hoped to break down information 
barriers and generate a greater synergy across the public sector. We are lucky to have support from our senior leadership CE Ping Soon and 
GCDTO Cheow Hoe in driving adoption of the portal and setting the direction that all of GovTech’s product developer portals should be accessed from the 
developer portal.

As we continued to work on the developer portal to fulfil that original vision, it also became clear that it was now the logical channel through which we 
could engage our burgeoning community. After all, our community building efforts were driven by the same underlying desire to break down information 
barriers - especially barriers to Government products and services - as well as to create a space for knowledge to be shared.
